## Introducing Chunking for Large Files

When working with very large datasets, a common challenge in environments like Colab is that the entire dataset may not fit into the available memory (RAM). Attempting to load such a dataset directly can lead to `MemoryError` or significantly slow down your system. This is where **chunking** becomes an essential strategy.

### What is Chunking?
Chunking is a technique where a large file is read and processed in smaller, manageable pieces (chunks) rather than loading the entire file into memory at once. Each chunk is processed sequentially, and once processing is complete, the memory occupied by that chunk can be freed before the next chunk is loaded.

### Why is Chunking Necessary?
*   **Memory Constraints**: Datasets often exceed the RAM capacity of the computing environment (e.g., Colab's allocated memory). Chunking allows processing of data that is larger than available memory.
*   **Efficient Resource Usage**: By processing data incrementally, chunking helps in maintaining stable memory usage, preventing system crashes and improving overall stability for long-running processes.

### How it Works:
When you read a file in chunks, you specify a `chunksize` (e.g., number of rows for tabular data). The reading function then returns an iterator, which yields one chunk at a time. Your code processes this chunk, performs any necessary operations (filtering, aggregation, transformation), and then moves to the next chunk. Aggregated results can be combined after all chunks have been processed.

### Benefits of Chunking:
*   **Reduced Memory Consumption**: The primary benefit is a drastic reduction in memory usage, as only a small portion of the data is held in memory at any given time.
*   **Ability to Process Very Large Datasets**: It enables you to work with datasets that would otherwise be impossible to handle on a given machine.
*   **Iterative Processing**: It facilitates iterative algorithms and allows for partial results to be generated as data streams in.
*   **Improved Stability**: By managing memory efficiently, chunking prevents memory-related errors and improves the stability of your data processing pipelines.

In the next steps, we will demonstrate how to implement chunking when reading a large CSV file to manage memory effectively.
